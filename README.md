# MahjongCore
MahjongCore is a .NET Library published via a NuGet package. It contains the functionality needed to execute a game of Japanese Mahjong.

There are two main release branches to this project:
- v2: This is a legacy version of MahjongCore which is less supported and incomplete, but is in a quasi-usable state for certain applications. It is here for those applications to continue to use without interruption.
- v3: This is the current version of MahjongCore which is being refactored into a more sensible package with better API architecture.

There is no v1 package, as this was a personal project that was refactored massively to produce MahjongCore v2.

# License
This project is open source, and the NuGet packages may be used freely to produce your own mahjong application without restriction. Only owners of this project may commit code to it, though. Please make note that your application makes use of MahjongCore.
